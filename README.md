## About the Project

MedFixture is an application to book and manage the appointments of a hospital or clinic. The application itself doesn't save any data, that is, the login credentials, authentication data and patients' data is not hard programmed in the python script. The data which is handled by the application is actualy stored in an SQLite database. The appication itself can be used by several people and institutions. We just need to connect it the corresponding database.

### Features
* Uses a master login window to access the database and make data transactions. It even has a _Login as Guest_ feature to login for only viewing the data and not editing the database.

</p>

* If the user forgets the password, the application also has a feature to reset the password using the saved secret questions. The option to reset password usign OTP/reset link will be pushed in the upcoming versions hopefully.

* If logged in using an user, authenticated by the credentials from the database, a new toplevel window opens and show the profile details. It also gives options to add, edit or delete the appointments.
